Welcome to the Golden Estate website!

Summary of the project:

We have a navigation for the three pages with a submenu for the gallery page.

On the home page there is an image slider with all properties.

On the gallery page are displayed all the properties with different ways for sorting and filtering. There is also a search option by name or location. The properties are paginated with a maximum of 9 per page. From here we can select a specific one.

On the property page we can check all the images and information for the selected one, there is also a map displaying the location.

Finally we have a contacts page with information about the company and a map.

Future improvements:

I want to add the filters on the gallery page to the url so we do not lose them when navigating between pages.
